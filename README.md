## Database Management and Time_series_analysis

Build a local database and perform time series analysis with machine learning with processed data from the database.

### Workflow

1. Use Python and SQLAlchemy to build a local database with SQLite
2. Utilize advanced SQL queries to perform cleaning and database management (createing tables and table relaions) operations
3. Performed ANOVA and correlation statistical tests to determine statistical relationship between attributes
4. Performed seasonal decomposition of the selected columns to test for seasonlity in the data
5. Use Python to perfrom time series analysis with ARIMA model 
6. Use other machine learning models (**Deep Neural Network** and **Random Forest**) make predictions  and compare performance
