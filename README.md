## Database Management and Time_series_analysis

Build a local database and perform time series analysis with machine learning with processed data from the database.

1. ![sql alchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy.png?size=25) Build your own local database 
2. ![sql](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser.png?size=20) Manage the database: _Create, modify, and delete tables and table elements_
3. 🗒️ Query your database for insights using SQL 
4. 🤖 Perform time series analysis using machine learning with data from your processed database. 

### Workflow

>>>> Create a local data base using Python and SQLalchemy

>>>> Load data onto the database 

>>>> Use advanced SQL queries to perform cleaning operations (create tables and table relationships) (modify tables and table elements)

>>>> Perform ANOVA and correlation statistical tests to determine statistical relationship between attributes

>>>> Test for seasonlity in the data using __seasonal decomposition__

>>>> Time series analysis with ARIMA model in Python

>>>> Generate predictions and test model performance using **Deep Neural Networks** and **Random Forest algorithm**)
